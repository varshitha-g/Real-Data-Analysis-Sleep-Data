# Real Data Analysis: Comparing Parametric and Nonparametric Methods for Evaluating Sleep Data

## Overview
This project investigates the impact of two sleep conditions on sleep duration using statistical methods:
- **Parametric Test:** Paired t-test
- **Non-parametric Test:** Wilcoxon signed-rank test

Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the effectiveness of both methods, assess normality, and visualize the results.

## Features
- Comparison of statistical methods for paired data
- Visualizations including box plots, normal probability plots, and power curves
- Python implementation for generating and analyzing simulated sleep datasets

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy

## Key Insights
- Parametric methods are more sensitive to small effect sizes under normality.
- Non-parametric methods provide robustness when data deviate from normal distributions.

## Statistical Tests Conducted
- Paired t-test
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test
- Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
